## Kadena Light Client

This is a light client for the Kadena blockchain. It is written in Rust and lives in the workspace defined in this directory. In this README we will go over a few details that need to be known before hopping into development.

For a more detailed overview of the Light Client and its components, and how to run and benchmark it, you can refer to the mdBook at https://argumentcomputer.github.io/zk-light-clients/kadena

It can also be run locally with:

```bash
cd docs && \
  mdbook serve --open
```

Then navigate to [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

## Layout

The workspace is divided into the following:

- `light-client`: The main library that contains the light client implementation. It has two main roles:
    - proof server: Produces proofs regarding the latest longest chain and inclusion of some transactions in the state Merkle Tree.
    - client: Coordinate data communication between the Kadena chain and the proof server to generate the right proofs at the right time.
- `core`: The core library that contains the data structures and utilities used by the light client.
- `kadena-programs`: A library that exposes the Sphinx programs used to generate proofs for our light client.
- `programs/*`: Actual implementations of the Sphinx programs.

## Logging Configuration

The light client uses two logging systems:

- Rust logging via `tokio-tracing`, configured through the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. See the [tracing documentation](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html) for detailed configuration options.
- Go logging for FFI calls, configured through the `SP1_GO_LOG` environment variable.

To set a global log level (e.g. warn), configure both variables:

```bash
RUST_LOG=warn SP1_GO_LOG=warn cargo run ...
```

Valid log levels are: error, warn, info, debug, trace, off

## Development

When developing, you might have to update the programs' implementation. The programs implementations are located in
`./programs/*` and the compiled binaries are located in
`./kadena-programs/artifacts`. Currently, artifacts binaries are generated in two ways:

- Automated: There is a build script located at
  `./kadena-programs/build.rs` that will compile all the programs and place them in the `./kadena-programs/artifacts`
  folder. To enable this feature, it is needed to set the environment variable `LC_PROGRAM_AUTOBUILD=1`.
- Manual: You can also compile the programs manually using `make` by running the following command in the
  `./kadena-programs` folder:
  ```shell
    make
    ```
